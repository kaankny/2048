<h1>2048 Clone</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>This project is a clone of the popular 2048 game developed using Unity. The game involves sliding numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048.</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of this project is to recreate the mechanics of the 2048 game using Unity and Scriptable Objects for managing game tiles. This project demonstrates the use of Unity for game development and how Scriptable Objects can be utilized for efficient data management.</p>

<h2>Project Contents</h2>

<h3>Game Mechanics</h3>
<p>The game consists of a 4x4 grid of tiles. Each tile has a number, and players can slide the tiles in four directions (up, down, left, right). When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one tile with double the value. The goal is to create a tile with the number 2048.</p>

<h3>Scriptable Objects</h3>
<p>All the tiles in the game are managed using Scriptable Objects. This allows for efficient data management and easy updates to the tile properties.</p>
